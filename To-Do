Tips
Use Git for source control.
Document your code and project setup.
Focus on security for user roles and sensitive data.

1. Define Project Goals and Features
Identify the main features of your bug tracking system:

User Roles: Admin, Developer, and Tester.
Bug Reporting: Users can log bugs with details like title, severity, status, etc.
Bug Assignment: Assign bugs to specific developers.
Bug Status Tracking: Track progress (open, in progress, resolved).
Search & Filter: Find bugs by severity, status, and assignee.
Notifications: Notify users of updates.


2. Choose Tools and Technologies
Backend: Use Python with Django (recommended) or Flask for structure.

Database: Use SQLite for local testing or PostgreSQL in production.

Frontend: Optional â€“ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a simple web UI.

Testing: Use unittest or pytest for functionality checks.

Version Control: Track code changes with Git.



3. Design the System Structure
Outline key components before starting:

Entities:

User: Represents admins, developers, and testers.
Bug: Core entity with fields for title, description, severity, status, etc.
Database Tables:

Users: (user_id, username, role)
Bugs: (bug_id, title, description, status, severity, reporter_id, assignee_id)
Workflow:

Users log in with roles.
Testers report bugs; developers update statuses.
Admins oversee bug management and assignments.
